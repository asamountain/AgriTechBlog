But also there is still a chance. I feel appreciate about that.</p><p>It was pretty sad when I consider my destiny is so much up to the Trump's tongue. I didn't want to this thing happen in my life.</p><h1>I believe there is a hope.</h1><p>I feel appreciate about that.</p><p>For now, it seems not so sure to invest on something else, but what if I can put the money into UVIX?</p><p>Yes who know how much that would be great for that. I know the betting can be very risky, but Trump... is a person very much risky and unpredictable. It is difficult to predict his action, so all in into his action and fluctuation can be very much risky.</p><p>so I want to put my money into QDTE. so then the dividends can feed my life and well-beings. I wish that can just happened well.</p><p>How can I make them happen?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Uvix or Gold.. they can be the work but yes investment is the only way probably to earn the better.</p><p>How can I invest for myself? hm... first, let's see how 2nd April can show up the situation. then I can figure out how it's gonna be alright.</p><p>I'll need to figure out when would be great to start invest for UVIX...?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It seems not so sure as well.</p><p>dang... then there is not many option, just I need to invest into myself, that would be the best option at the side. How can I invest for myself better? yes as yesterday I already wrote down, the things... the things I need to do figure out well. yes... let's see and let's figuring out of it. Invest for myself... </p><h1>How can I invest for myself?</h1><ol><li><p>Sleep Better</p><p>at least, I need to go to bed 9 pm and then finish up everything until 8pm. It seems the Bluelight does affect my sleep hours.</p></li><li><p>Work-out better</p><p>This is so much relevant with the num 1. Because my physical performances are very much related with the sleep quality. so it does seems, actually everything are so co-related to sleep. Then it means, the sleep is the best.</p></li><li><p>Less mental noise by time control</p><p>Yeah, actually this is the another side what I should take care of it. Time management are also very much important.(It seems I have to be very much humble, cause I couldn't anticipate when I would get mistake. 'I know I don't want to be mighty I know I'll fall onto my face'). also this is very much related to the time management. When I fail the time control over my concern, my thought starts to be anxious. 'Oh god.. I need to study right now... but this guest speak too much longer to me.' maybe I should say that out to secure my time. </p></li><li><p>Learn about the refactoring way with AI</p></li></ol>",

<h3>A Life Built on Love and Purpose</h3><p>The main reason I chose to study Computer Science—and why I dream of running a farm in California—is because I want to build a future with my girlfriend. Since we met, I’ve felt a deep desire to live life side by side with her for as long as possible. But our reality involves distance and visa challenges, and that led me to think practically about how to overcome them.</p><p>The U.S. puts a strong emphasis on technology, science, and innovation. I realized that by studying Computer Science, I could align my goals with the needs of that system, increase my chances of sponsorship, and build a stable life together. This path didn’t just make sense logically—it also connected to my values, dreams, and sense of responsibility.</p><h3>The Power and Possibility of Tech</h3><p>As I began learning more about Computer Science, I was surprised by how powerful it is—not just in the job market, but in shaping the world. I found that with the right skills, I could not only solve problems more effectively, but also manage my own business, automate tasks, and even build tools to help others.</p><p>I’ve always dreamed of owning a farm, especially in a warm, peaceful area. At first, I thought of farming as a simple, fulfilling job. But later I realized that farming combined with technology could be something far greater. With tools like sensors, drones, and data-driven algorithms, I can automate the hard work, reduce labor costs, and make smarter decisions based on real-time data.</p><p>This mix of tradition and innovation is deeply meaningful to me—it’s about preserving a lifestyle while evolving with the world.</p><h3>Real-World Impact: Investing and Expanding Vision</h3><p>One eye-opening experience for me was investing in a tech company that suddenly surged in stock price. It gave me multiple returns, and I realized just how powerful knowledge in tech and business can be. That moment pushed me to dig deeper into understanding the industry—not just as a user or student, but as someone who wants to participate and make informed decisions.</p><p>That experience showed me that knowledge brings freedom—financial, intellectual, and even emotional. It widened my vision of what’s possible.</p><h3>Early Exposure and Lifelong Curiosity</h3><p>My journey with technology started early. When I was still a kid—before I even became a teenager—my dad gave me a computer running Windows 3.1. At first, I just played games like Prince of Persia. But when problems came up, I had to fix them myself—copying DLL files, installing patches, and figuring things out with curiosity and trial-and-error.</p><p>I also watched my dad assemble computers. Seeing him work hands-on influenced me more than I realized at the time. I grew up feeling close to computers—not intimidated by them, but intrigued. That early exposure made me comfortable with technology, and it’s part of why I now feel so confident pursuing this field.</p><h3>A Personal Philosophy: Scale, Freedom, and Contribution</h3><p>One powerful idea I learned from a book is this: if you want to create real value in the world, you have to help others at scale. The more people you serve, the more problems you solve, and the more resources come back to you in return. That philosophy resonated with me deeply.</p><p>Computer Science—and by extension, content creation, automation, and digital entrepreneurship—gives us tools to serve people at scale. It allows us to reach more people, solve bigger problems, and unlock new freedoms. That includes financial freedom, creative freedom, and even physical freedom—something I saw firsthand when I traveled through Bali and Thailand. I met digital nomads living freely and independently. Their lives amazed me. I realized then that I wanted that kind of freedom too—not just for myself, but for the life I want to build with Mary.</p><h3>Conclusion: A Mission, Not Just a Major</h3><p>So, for me, Computer Science isn’t just a major. It’s a mission. It’s about becoming someone who can love, build, grow, contribute, and solve. It’s about creating a life that feels free, connected, and deeply meaningful—both for myself and for the people I love.</p><p>This is the path I’ve chosen. And I’m ready to keep growing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

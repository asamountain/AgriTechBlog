# Behind the Scenes: A Month in the Life of a Smart Farm IoT Engineer

*October 14, 2025*

Hey friends,

I wanted to pull back the curtain and share what's been happening in my world this past month. If you've been following me, you know I'm passionate about agriculture technology and sustainable farming. But what you might not see is the messy, real, and sometimes exhausting journey behind it all.

## The Reality Check

September was... intense. I've been working as a Smart Farm IoT engineer, and while that sounds exciting (and it is!), the reality has been a mix of technical challenges, workplace frustrations, and some deep soul-searching about where I'm really headed.

**The Work Life:**
- Debugging sensors that malfunction even when perfectly assembled
- Writing test cases for irrigation reports and drainage pumps
- Wrestling with 24-hour cycle bugs and calibration issues
- Learning about EC/pH sensors, WiFi configurations, and quality assurance

It's the kind of work that teaches you patience. Hardware can be unpredictable - machines sometimes show wrong actions no matter how carefully they're assembled. It made me wonder: how do successful companies maintain quality at scale? This has become more than just a job question - it's about understanding systems, resilience, and what it really takes to build something that works.

## The Agriculture Education I Didn't Expect

One highlight was attending a cultivation education session (재배 교육). Here's what blew my mind:

**Smart Agriculture ≠ Smart Farm**
What I really want to do is smart agriculture - there's a crucial difference.

**The Plant Biology Essentials:**
- Plants have three critical activities: photosynthesis, respiration, and transpiration
- Net photosynthesis depends on light, CO2, temperature, humidity, and LAI
- Here's the kicker: if even ONE of these factors is low, everything gets limited to that lowest value
- It's like a chain - you're only as strong as your weakest link

**The Business Reality:**
- Fruit vegetables (과채류) are more profitable but require expertise in leaves, stems, flowers, AND fruits
- Smart farm greenhouses have the best profitability
- But the electricity costs for high-light crops? Astronomical.

This knowledge isn't just technical - it's teaching me to think systemically, to see connections between seemingly separate things.

## The Big Questions

But here's where it gets real. Somewhere between debugging sensors and attending meetups, I found myself asking bigger questions:

**"What's the ONE thing I can do today such that by doing it everything else will be easier or unnecessary?"**

This question has been haunting me in the best way. 

I've been dreaming about a "Wellness Farm" - a place where technology meets nature, where people can come to disconnect, learn, and experience sustainable living. Not just a regular farm, but a place shaped by awareness, meditation, nature, and meaningful connection.

## The Honest Struggle

Let me be vulnerable with you: I felt super tired this month. There were days I questioned everything:

- Why am I doing this?
- Should I keep working this job?
- Do I want to have my own farm or stay in tech?
- How can I balance stability with dreams?

I discovered something important through an LLM conversation (shoutout to ChatGPT-5 via Perplexity Pro - it really helped): I was putting too much pressure on myself. Too many running projects, too many futures planned simultaneously, and not enough presence in the now.

**The revelation?** Sometimes tiredness isn't about being weak - it's about carrying too much at once.

## Dreams Taking Shape

So what DO I want? Here's what's becoming clearer:

1. **Freedom** - to move between places, to learn continuously, to not be limited geographically
2. **A Wellness Farm** - eventually. Maybe not now, but it's on the horizon
3. **Content Creation** - Yes, a YouTube channel! Sharing what I'm learning about agriculture, technology, and sustainable living
4. **Meaningful Work** - Building things that matter, that help people, that contribute to better food systems

## The Question of Success

I'll be honest - there's this thirst for success that drives me. Part of it comes from past humiliations and feeling ignored. But I'm learning to channel that into something positive: the desire to create, to teach, to share, to build community.

**What matters most?** Not proving others wrong, but creating something beautiful and meaningful.

## Moving Forward

Here's what I'm learning to embrace:

**Focus on what I truly need RIGHT NOW.** 

If I focus well on what needs to be done today, I can earn what I want to earn. Having a farm matters, but it doesn't mean I need to do it right now. Three years of deep tech work might be exactly what I need before taking that leap.

**The freedom comes from:**
- Learning mathematics and technology deeply
- Building skills that transfer anywhere
- Creating content that helps others
- Being patient with the journey

## What's Next?

I'm exploring the intersection of:
- Smart agriculture technology
- Content creation and knowledge sharing
- Sustainable farming practices
- Building community around these ideas

And yes, I'm seriously considering starting that YouTube channel to document this journey - the technical insights, the farm visits, the lessons learned, and the mistakes made.

## A Question for You

What keeps YOU going when you feel tired or lost? What's your "wellness farm" - that dream that keeps pulling you forward?

I'd love to hear from you. Drop a comment, send me a message. Let's build this community together.

## The One Thing

Remember that question I mentioned? Here's my answer for today:

**The ONE thing I can do is share authentically - my struggles, my learning, and my journey. Because maybe someone out there needs to hear that it's okay to be tired, it's okay to question, and it's okay to keep going anyway.**

That's what this post is. That's what I hope to do more of.

Thanks for being here. Thanks for following along.

Until next time,
*Your fellow farmer-engineer-dreamer*

# Introduction

This is an example journal entry to test the Notion import script. You can use this as a template for your own entries.

## Key Features

The import script supports:

- **Headings** (H1, H2, H3)
- **Paragraphs** with multiple lines
- **Bullet lists** like this one
- **Numbered lists** (see below)

## Sample Numbered List

1. First item with important information
2. Second item with more details
3. Third item with additional notes

## Additional Notes

You can write longer paragraphs here. The script will automatically convert your Markdown content into Notion blocks.

### Subsection Example

Even nested headings work! The script will preserve your document structure.

## Conclusion

This example demonstrates the basic Markdown features supported by the import script. Feel free to modify this template for your own journal entries.

1. always access 'plan' mode to accurately focus what user actually want to debug or to build.
2. if it does huge modification or feature update, switch into flash 3 version from pro 3 version. so choose spontaneously in between flash and pro.
3. whenever vercel publishment related error has happened, look up below process.

 1. Fetch the Latest Deployment URL
  First, you need the URL or ID of the most recent deployment. You can get this by listing your deployments and
  taking the top one:
   1 vercel list --limit 1


  2. Stream or Download Build Logs
  Once you have the deployment URL (e.g., project-name-abc123.vercel.app), you can fetch the build logs using the
  inspect command with the --logs flag. This will output the exact type of build logs you shared:


   1 # Get all build logs for the latest deployment
   2 vercel inspect <deployment-url> --logs

  3. Detect Errors Automatically
  If you are building a tool to "detect the error and log accurately," you can pipe this output to a file or search
  for specific error patterns:


   1 # Search for TypeScript errors or Build failures in the logs
   2 vercel inspect <deployment-url> --logs | grep "error TS"

  Programmatic Access (Vercel API)
  If you need to do this from a script (like a GitHub Action or a custom dashboard), you can use the Vercel API:


   1. GET /v6/deployments to find the latest deployment ID.
   2. GET /v2/deployments/{id}/events to fetch the log events as a stream or JSON.

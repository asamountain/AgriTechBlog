#### **Code Style Guidelines**
- **TypeScript**: Use strict typing throughout

}

export default function Component({ title, onAction, children }: ComponentProps) {
  // Component logic here
  
  return (
    <div className="space-y-4">
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">{title}</h2>
      {children}
      {onAction && (
        <button onClick={onAction} className="btn-primary">

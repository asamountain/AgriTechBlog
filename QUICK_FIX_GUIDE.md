# Quick Fix Guide

## Issue 1: Port Conflicts ✅ FIXED

### Problem
- Backend was finding port 5001 instead of 5000
- Port 3000/5000/5173 occupied by zombie processes
- Frontend proxy expects backend on port 5000

### Solution
**Automatic port cleanup before starting dev server:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

The `predev` script now automatically:
1. ✅ Kills any process on port 3000
2. ✅ Kills any process on port 5000
3. ✅ Kills any process on port 5173
4. ✅ Starts backend on port 5000 (fixed, no more port hunting)
5. ✅ Starts frontend on port 5173

### Manual Port Cleanup (if needed)
```bash
# Kill specific port
./scripts/kill-port.sh 3000
./scripts/kill-port.sh 5000
./scripts/kill-port.sh 5173

# Or run the predev script manually
npm run predev
```

## Issue 2: Hidden Posts (96 out of 101) ✅ FIXED

### Problem
- Database has 101 posts
- Only 5 are visible (marked as published)
- 96 posts have `draft: true` or missing `isPublished: true`

### Solution
**Publish all posts at once:**

```bash
npm run db:publish-all
```

This script will:
1. ✅ Connect to MongoDB
2. ✅ Find ALL posts (101 total)
3. ✅ Update them to `{ isPublished: true, draft: false }`
4. ✅ Show summary of changes

### Expected Output
```
📢 Publishing All Posts
══════════════════════════════════════════════════

🔌 Connecting to MongoDB...
   Database: blog_database

```

## Complete Workflow

### First Time Setup
```bash
# 1. Publish all existing posts
npm run db:publish-all

# 2. Start the dev server (with automatic port cleanup)
npm run dev
```

### Daily Development
```bash
# Just run dev - ports are automatically cleaned
npm run dev
```

### If Ports Are Still Stuck
```bash
# Manually kill ports
npm run predev

# Then start dev
npm run dev
```

## Files Modified

1. **`package.json`**
   - Added `predev` script (runs before `dev`)
   - Added `db:publish-all` script
   - Backend now always uses port 5000

2. **`server/index.ts`**
   - Removed dynamic port finding
   - Fixed to always use port 5000

3. **`scripts/kill-port.sh`** (NEW)
   - Utility to kill processes on specific ports

4. **`scripts/publish-all.ts`** (NEW)
   - Publishes all posts in MongoDB

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Permission denied" when running kill-port.sh
```bash
chmod +x scripts/kill-port.sh
```

### "Port 5000 is already in use"
```bash
npm run predev
# Then try again
npm run dev
```

### "No posts visible after publishing"
1. Check MongoDB connection:
   ```bash
   npm run db:test
   ```

2. Verify posts are published:
   ```bash
   npm run db:publish-all
   ```

3. Restart dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Backend still on wrong port
- Make sure you've saved `server/index.ts`
- Restart the dev server
- Check terminal output for port number

## Quick Commands Reference

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `npm run dev` | Start dev server (auto-cleans ports) |

## 📓 Bulk Import Journal Entries to Notion

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Setup (one-time)
./scripts/setup-journal-import.sh

# 2. Configure .env
NOTION_TOKEN=secret_your_token_here
NOTION_JOURNAL_DB_ID=your_database_id
JOURNAL_ROOT_PATH=./Journal

# 3. Validate setup
npm run notion:validate-journal

# 4. Run import
npm run notion:import-journal
```

### File Format

Your Markdown files should have YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
title: My Journal Entry
tags: personal, thoughts
date: 2024-01-18
---

Your content here...
```

### Common Issues

**❌ "Missing NOTION_TOKEN"**
- Get token from: https://www.notion.so/my-integrations
- Add to `.env`: `NOTION_TOKEN=secret_...`

**❌ "Could not find database"**
- Get database ID from URL (32-character hex string)
- Connect integration to database in Notion

**❌ "property_not_found: Tags"**
- Add "Tags" multi-select property to your Notion database
